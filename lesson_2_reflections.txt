What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The command to initialize or create a repo is 'git init'. If you enter 'ls -a' in your terminal it will show you a 'hidden' file '.git' which tells you that your file is now a git file, and your repository is now ready to start tracking files that you add/delete/update.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	When you're ready to commit a file that you've been working on, you add it to the staging area. Files that are not ready to be committed will remain in the working directory, perhaps because you're not done updating the file, or the file doesn't logically relate to another file you want to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	
	When I add a file to the staging area I can compare the changes made to that file to the changes made in other files that are still in the working directory. We use the 'git diff' command to do this. Running this command will show me all the changes made in the file(s) in the staging area and those still in the working directory, and I can determine if I can add other changed files into the staging area so that my commit reflects all logical changes made.
